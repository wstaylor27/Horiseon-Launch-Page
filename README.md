<h2>HW-1</h2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

This was my first homework assignment. In order to navigate through this work, one must understand that all website pages are not created equally. There will be inoperable links, bizarre formating, and redundant classes. The objective of the homework was to identify the issues, correct them and ensure the code is legible.To begin, I read both html and css files. I wanted to understand the relationship between the files and how the elements reacted.

#Semantics

When initially looking over the html structure, I noticed a ton of div tags. I replaced div with nav tag so that the tag could be properly associated with the links. Also nav is a semantic element making it easier to search through the entire code. I did the same for the header, main, aside and sections.
  
#Links
  
In the header, I noticed there was a # in the href. This # is associated with an id. In the main below, two of the three elements have ids. I inserted an id for seo so that the link would become active.
 
#Misc
  
Comments were added for clarity. I also added some spacing for legibility purposes.
